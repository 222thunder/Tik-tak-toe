# 🎮 Solo Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)

A simple terminal-based Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game — designed for solo play or testing game logic. Ideal for beginners learning Python or working on small console projects.

## 🧩 Features

- 3x3 grid with clean board display  
- Input validation for position selection  
- Turn-based player logic  
- Win/draw detection and game-over handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running the Game

1. Clone this repository or download the `solotiktaktoe.py` file.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the file's directory.
3. Run the game using:

```bash
python solotiktaktoe.py
````

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to play!

## 📂 File Structure

```
solotiktaktoe.py   # Main game script
```

## 🙋‍♂️ How It Works

* Players take turns choosing a cell number (1–9) corresponding to the board layout.
* The script checks for a winner after every move.
* If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## 📌 Example Board Layout

```
 1 | 2 | 3
